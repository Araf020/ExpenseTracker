# ExpenseTracker

Welcome to the Expenses Tracking .NET project!

This project is designed to help you track your expenses by allowing you to input your daily expenses and categorize them. The application will then generate detailed reports, showing you how much you have spent in each category over a specific period.

        User authentication: You can create an account, login, and securely store your expenses.

        Expense entry: You can input your daily expenses, including the date, amount, and category.

        Categorization: The application allows you to categorize your expenses by creating custom categories or selecting from pre-defined categories.

        Reporting: The application generates detailed reports, showing you how much you have spent in each category over a specific period.
